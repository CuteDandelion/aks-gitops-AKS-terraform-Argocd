## Overview

This project sets up a cloud-native **Kanban board app** on a Production-grade **Kubernetes cluster** running on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. It uses **Terraform** to handle the entire infrastructure on **Azure**, and **GitHub Actions** powers a reliable **CI/CD pipeline**. An **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** is created for managing **Docker images**, and the **NGINX Ingress Controller** is used to manage global traffic securely and efficientlyâ€”including **HTTPS** support. The setup is designed for scalability, security, and smooth performance. It includes **Cert-Manager** for automatic **SSL certificates**, **ExternalDNS** for real-time DNS updates, **Helm** for managing **Kubernetes packages**, **ArgoCD** for **GitOps-based** deployment, and **Prometheus** & **Grafana** for full-stack monitoring and visibility.

##  Deployment to Azure

This project automates the deployment of the Kanban board application to Azure using a modern GitOps-driven workflow built on AKS, Terraform, and GitHub Actions. The deployment process includes the following stages:

1. **Dockerisation:**
   
   The application is containerised using the `Dockerfile` located in the `app/` directory. This ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

3. **Building and Pushing the Docker Image:**
    
   When code changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the `docker-build.yml` GitHub Actions workflow is triggered. It builds the Docker image, runs a **Trivy** vulnerability scan, and pushes the image to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.

5. **Infrastructure Validation (on Pull Request):**
   
   When a Pull Request modifies Terraform code, the `tf-plan.yml` workflow runs automatically. It executes:
   - `terraform plan` to preview infrastructure changes  
   - `tflint` to ensure Terraform syntax and standards  
   - `checkov` to scan for security and compliance issues  

7. **Infrastructure Provisioning (on Merge):**
   
   Once approved and merged, the `tf-apply.yml` workflow provisions or updates infrastructure on Azure using **Terraform**, including ACR, AKS, identity, networking, and DNS.

9. **GitOps Deployment via ArgoCD:**
    
   **ArgoCD** continuously watches the Git repository (under `k8s-manifests/`) and automatically syncs Kubernetes manifests to the AKS cluster. This ensures that the live environment always reflects the desired state stored in Git.

11. **Ingress, SSL, and DNS Setup:**
      
   - **NGINX Ingress Controller** handles HTTPS routing within the AKS cluster.  
   - **Cert-Manager** automatically issues and renews SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt.  
   - **ExternalDNS** syncs Kubernetes ingress records with **Azure DNS**, enabling real-time domain mapping.

11. **Monitoring and Observability:**
    
   **Prometheus** collects metrics from the cluster and workloads. **Grafana** dashboards provide real-time insights into application and infrastructure health.


## ðŸ“¸ Kanban Board App: Live on Azure with GitOps, Monitoring, and CI/CD

### âœ… ArgoCD: GitOps Deployment to AKS

Kanban App is continuously deployed to AKS using ArgoCD. All Kubernetes manifests are stored in Git (`k8s-manifests/`), and ArgoCD keeps the AKS cluster in sync with the Git source of truth.

### âœ… Prometheus & Grafana: Full-Stack Observability

**Prometheus** scrapes metrics from the AKS cluster, workloads, and system components. **Grafana** provides real-time dashboards and alerting for system health, resource usage, and more.

**Prometheus Targets View:**

### âœ… CI/CD Pipeline via GitHub Actions

Every change to the codebase or infrastructure triggers GitHub Actions workflows that run Docker builds, security scans, Terraform plans, and apply changes automatically upon merge.

**Successful CI/CD Workflow Execution:**

### âœ… Cloudflare DNS Configuration

The Kanban board app and monitoring tools are publicly accessible via custom subdomains managed in **Cloudflare**.

DNS `CNAME` records are configured in Cloudflare to point to the Azure Ingress or Front Door endpoints for the following services:

- `kanban.hanadisa.com` â†’ Kanban board app
- `grafana.hanadisa.com` â†’ Grafana dashboards
- `prometheus.hanadisa.com` â†’ Prometheus monitoring UI

This setup enables:

- Clean, branded, and user-friendly URLs
- Real-time DNS resolution via **ExternalDNS**
- Secure HTTPS access via certificates provisioned by **Cert-Manager**
